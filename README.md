This framewrok aims at creating 3d models with **SVG** and concise APIs. It is purely developed with concepts of two-dimension.
One of its essential implementations is **Bezier** in both curve and surface. 
It is one thing to describe them with mathematic equotions, another thing to illustrate with computer graphic.
